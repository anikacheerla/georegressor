Geolocalization, determining precise locations from vi- sual cues, poses challenges due to environmental complex- ity. Inspired by Geoguessr, we develop a robust system using advanced computer vision and language models to predict locations from street-level images. Additionally, we explore model interpretability to understand decision-making processes and address biases.
